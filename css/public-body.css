/***********************************************************
Basic responsive layout

In Hello Elementor Theme, this applies to .site-header, and
also to .site-main, which is a class of the <main> element,
at the condition that the page is not built with Elementor:
    body:not([class*="elementor-page-"])
Therefore, in pages built with Elementor, proper layout is
applied only to features managed by Elementor, not others.

The Footnotes references container is near the end of main.
This style sheet lets Footnotesâ€™ reference container come
into the benefit of the basic responsive layout style rules
that would apply if the page were not built with Elementor.

This is mainly useful with Hello Elementor, but it might be
used also with another theme depriving the features from
other plugins of basic layout rules as applied to content.

The enqueuing of this style sheet is optional. The setting
is in the dashboard under Settings > Reference container.
