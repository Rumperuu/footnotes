== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is your Plugin a copy of footnotes x? =

No, this Plugin has been written from scratch. Of course some inspirations on how to do or how to not do things were taken from other plugins.

= Your Plugin is awesome! How do I convert my footnotes if I used one of the other footnotes plugins out there? =

1. For anyone interested in converting from the FD Footnotes plugin:
Visit this swift write-up from a **footnotes** user by the name of **Southwest**: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-make-this-footnote-style?replies=6#post-5946306
2. From what we've researched, all other footnotes Plugins use open and close shortcodes, which can be left as is. In the **footnotes** settings menu, you can setup **footnotes** to use the existing (=previously used) shortcodes. Too easy? Yippy Ki-Yey!
